                                            BUILDING OF RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
                                            
This project presents the development of a multi-phase story recommendation engine designed to deliver relevant and engaging Telugu stories based on user behavior, popularity, time trends, and real-world context. The system begins with a popularity-based recommender that suggests widely appreciated stories suitable for new or anonymous users. It then advances to a collaborative filtering model, offering personalized recommendations by analyzing patterns in user ratings. A time-based recommendation phase highlights stories that have remained consistently popular over the years or during specific periods, capturing shifting reader interests. Finally, a context-aware recommendation system integrates real-world festivals and holidays by using semantic text similarity and external API data to recommend culturally relevant stories. This layered approach ensures both personalized and occasion-specific story suggestions, enhancing the readerâ€™s experience and making the platform more interactive, intelligent, and culturally meaningful.
